# Checklist-SwiftUI
ToDo iOS application made with SwiftUI. 
This is my result after completing section two of the iOS Apprentice book. 
In chapter 13 I did not use the extensions provided, rather, I follow another workaround as suggested in https://forums.raywenderlich.com/c/books/ios-apprentice/7.
This exemplifies the use of the list view with SwiftUI in a modularised approach.
